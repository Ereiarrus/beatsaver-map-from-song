Usage:

To use the script, first make sure that you have put all of the music you want downloaded into this folder; 
then, open this directory in cmd (cd into it if needed), and type `python beatsaver\ song\ downloader.py`.

If it complains that you have missing modules, just install them using pip (I hope you isntalled it when you were installing python!)

The output of the script creates a new directory called `__done` where all songs that were successfully (and potentailly partly successfully) downloaded into will be, and the maps (their directories) will be in this directory.

Happy downloading!
